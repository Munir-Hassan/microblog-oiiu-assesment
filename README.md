This project Bloging website is an assessment test for Junior Full Stack Developer role at OiiU.

Dear HR or the representatives from OiiU, Please have a look at the code base. Thank you.

Requirements:
Users can create a new post
Users can view otherâ€™s post
Users can like a post
Users can undo like on post
Users can see like count of a post

I have been able to complete all of the reqiurements except saving the number of likes per post
and only single likes per post. I was facing some dificulties with retrieving the database from 
mongoDB Atlas cloud. But I was able to get the number of likes a post has if that is saved in database.


I was facing problems with manipulating the likes count per post.

I hope you can forgive, have some mercy and see through my failures and give me a chance
to fix them.

Thank you, Munir Hassan.
