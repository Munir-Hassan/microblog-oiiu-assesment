==> There are still some issues with the UI which i have yet to fix.  
==> I am having trouble set up the like per person per post feature.  
==> Mainly my idea was to push the userId of the user when he click the like button.  
==> The BlogPost Schema has likes of array type with userId stored those who click like.  
==> Each time I tried to the like array of a post it simply creates a new document with empty
    post. I am still trying to work on it and fix it.

I have been able to complete all of the reqiurements except saving the number of likes per post
and only single likes per post. I was facing some dificulties with retrieving the database from 
mongoDB Atlas cloud. But I was able to get the number of likes a post has if that is saved in database.


I was facing problems with manipulating the likes count per post.

I am still learning and I would love to have the oppurtunity to keep learning.

Thank you, Munir Hassan.
